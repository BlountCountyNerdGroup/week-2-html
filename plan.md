# Plan
The first website that we'll make while they're learning will be they're favorite TV show

Start out by explaining what HTML stands for
Also explain that it makes up the content, not the styling of a webpage

have them create a folder and html file in notepad

Explain that an HTML element looks like this <tagname> Your content here </tagname>
We always start out by telling the browser that we're writing HTML. We do that by writing <!doctype html>

A webpage is split into to parts: the <head></head> is where we put information about our website that the browser should know like the title of our page (let them try that out)

1st teach them about headings h1-h6 (have them make like 3 of them of different types)

Then teach them about paragraph tags (have them type out a sentence or two)

Then teach about links (something that allows you to click to another webpage) and how you can link locally or externally <a href="myWebsite.html"> vs <a href="http://www.google.com">

We also have lists <ol></ol> (ordered lists) and <ul></ul> (unordered lists). Inside of the lists, we can put <li> which stands for lines. Try making a ordered list of your favorite movies or TV shows. See what happens if you change ol to ul

Now teach teach them about images (get them to put in)
Next to each movie/tv show, put an image next to it

A link doesn't just have to include text. You could do something like this (taken from codebar.io)

<div>
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBjnfgnwXic">
    <img src="images/img4.jpg" alt="cute owl">
    <img src="images/img5.jpg" alt="another cute owl">
    
    Watch the video
  </a>
</div>

If you want to make something bold, you can add <strong> tags. Try it out! 
You can also use <em> to make something appear in italics
The last thing is that you can use <small> to make something appear small

Next week, we'll get into how you can fine tune the styling, so if you don't like the styling of anything, wait to learn CSS

After this point, they'll start working on a website for the animal shelter. It can include the following:

1. pictures of cute dogs and cats
2. A description of what to do if someone finds a stray animal
3. A heading that says something to the effect of "Animal Shelter"
4. An inspirational quote about why people should adopt pets (this could be in italics for special effect)
5. A link to some video with cute animals in it. Or maybe the link could be to the Humane Society's website. Basically just include a link.
6. Make a descriptive title for the webpage
